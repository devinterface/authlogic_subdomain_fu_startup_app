h1. Rails Authlogic + Subdomain Template

h2. IMPORTANT NOTE
This branch covers new Rails 3 version


This template works as a skeleton for any new Rails application (using Rails 3) that aims to provide authentication with subdomain support.

<pre><code>
git clone git://github.com/devinterface/authlogic_subdomain_fu_startup_app.git
cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml
bundle install  
rake db:migrate
</code></pre>

h2. Skeleton Behaviour

This template sets up a working application with support for authentication and subdomain. 

h3. Application workflow
* Guest access a public section of the site (http://localhost:3000) 
* Guest chooses to register new account (http://localhost:3000/account/new), including itself as user, and becomes account's owner
* Accounts owner goes to his account (subdomain) url (http://useraccount.localhost:3000/login) and logs into his account
* Accounts owner can add more users to it's account (http://useraccount.localhost:3000/users/new)
* Each created user can log into the account they belong
