h1. Sweatshop

A Rails plugin that generates "factory_girl":http://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl/tree/master Factories for all of your ActiveRecord models.

h2. Requirements

You should probably have the "factory_girl":http://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl/tree/master gem installed

h2. How to Install & Use

# Install the factory_girl gem
<pre><code>
gem install factory_girl
</code></pre>

# Install the plugin
<pre><code>
./script/plugin install git://github.com/mdarby/sweatshop.git
</code></pre>

# Run the following rake task to generate your Factories
<pre><code>
rake sweatshop:generate
</code></pre>

# Make sure you put the two following lines into spec/spec_helper.rb:
<pre><code>
require 'factory_girl'
Dir.glob("#{RAILS_ROOT}/spec/factories/*.rb").each{|factory| require factory}
</code></pre>

# Your Factories will now be automatically included whenever you run your specs.

That’s it!


h2. Notes

I use "RSpec":http://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec/tree/master for my BDD habit; you might use something else. Those two lines I mention above can be used in Test::Unit, I'm sure. However, it's up to you to figure out ;)
